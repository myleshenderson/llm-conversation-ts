## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Upload Connection Failed
```bash
‚ùå Upload connection test failed: ENOTFOUND api.example.com
```
**Solution**: Check your `UPLOAD_API_URL` in config.env

#### Invalid Conversation Format
```bash
‚ùå Upload failed: Invalid conversation format
```
**Solution**: Ensure the conversation file has valid JSON structure with required fields

#### Network Timeout
```bash
‚ùå Upload failed after 3 retries: Request timeout
```
**Solution**: Check your internet connection and firewall settings

#### File Not Found
```bash
‚ùå Upload failed: File not found: logs/conversation_123.json
```
**Solution**: Verify the file path exists and is accessible

### Retry Logic

The upload service includes robust retry logic:
- **Automatic Retries**: 3 attempts by default
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delays between retries (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Error Recovery**: Detailed error messages with suggested fixes
- **Connection Testing**: Pre-upload validation of API connectivity

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Configuration Issues

1. **Check Configuration**
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/start-conversation.ts --config
   ```

2. **Test API Connection**
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/start-conversation.ts --test-upload
   ```

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cat config.env | grep UPLOAD
   ```

### Upload Issues

1. **Check File Structure**
   ```bash
   # Verify conversation file is valid JSON
   cat logs/conversation_file.json | jq .
   ```

2. **Test with Minimal Example**
   ```bash
   # Generate simple test conversation
   npx tsx src/start-conversation.ts "Test" 2 --upload
   ```

3. **Enable Debug Logging**
   ```bash
   # Check logs for detailed error information
   tail -f logs/error.log
   ```

### Network Issues

1. **Test Direct API Access**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://uxx6unuo0e.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/upload \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"test": "connection"}'
   ```

2. **Check Firewall/Proxy Settings**
   - Ensure HTTPS connections to AWS are allowed
   - Check corporate firewall restrictions
   - Verify proxy configuration if applicable

- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time upload status and completion rates
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed logging of failed uploads with reasons
- **Selective Upload**: Upload specific ranges or recent files only

#### File Processing
- **Pattern Matching**: Finds conversation files by pattern
- **Validation**: Pre-upload validation to prevent API errors
- **Concurrent Uploads**: Single-threaded for reliability
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during batch operations
