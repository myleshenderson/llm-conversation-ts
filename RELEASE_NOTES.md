## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Generate and upload conversation
npx tsx src/start-conversation.ts "AI Discussion" 10 --upload

# Test upload system
npx tsx src/start-conversation.ts --test-upload

# Upload existing conversations
npx tsx src/upload-existing.ts --all
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# View configuration status
npx tsx src/start-conversation.ts --config

# Upload specific file
npx tsx src/start-conversation.ts --upload-file logs/conversation_123.json

# Upload recent conversations only
npx tsx src/upload-existing.ts --recent 5

# Force upload (override AUTO_UPLOAD=false)
npx tsx src/start-conversation.ts "Topic" 8 --upload

# Force no upload (override AUTO_UPLOAD=true)
npx tsx src/start-conversation.ts "Private" 5 --no-upload
```
